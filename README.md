As being part of an eco-system to showcase the abilities of vehicle event data provided by European OEM truck manufactures. The eco system consists of following components:
- rFMS Collector ( back-end scheduler to retrieve API-data from various interface like rFMS, RDW and OpenWeather.)
- rFMS Connect ( Front-end for the FleetManagement system -> https://rfmsconnect.nl or https://demo.rfmsconnect.nl)

This solution provides mocked data based on real vehicle event data. The real data will be processed anonymously. The processing of the data takes care of lifetime counters of the vehicle event data.

The solution is purely build in PHP is free to use for anybody.
